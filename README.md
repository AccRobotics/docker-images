docker pull ghcr.io/accrobotics/isaaclab:latest
```

### Building and Pushing Locally

To build the image locally:

./build_and_push.sh
```

To build and push the image to GHCR (requires Docker login):

```sh
./build_and_push.sh --push
```

You must be logged in to GHCR with Docker to push:

```sh
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
```
Where `CR_PAT` is a GitHub personal access token with `write:packages` scope.
